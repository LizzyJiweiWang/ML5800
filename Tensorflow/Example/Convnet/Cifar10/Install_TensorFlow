In Windows, you have to set the path to the installed Anaconda location

In example, I installed anaconda3 into C:\Anaconda

Therefore you need to add C:\Anaconda as well as C:\Anaconda\Scripts\ to your path variable, 

e.g. set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Anaconda;C:\Anaconda\Scripts\.

Hit the windows key -> enter environment -> choose from settings -> edit environment variables for your account 
-> select Path variable -> Edit -> New.
